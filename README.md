# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project allows two players to play the game directly in their browser.

## Demo

You can view the live version of the game on GitHub Pages (if you've set it up) or simply open the `index.html` file in any modern browser to play.

## Features

- Two-player mode: One player uses "O" and the other uses "X".
- Dynamic UI: The game board updates automatically after each move.
- Winner detection: The game checks for winning conditions after every move.
- Reset button: You can restart the game with the "Reset Game" button.
  
## Technologies Used
